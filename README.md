# proactive-chat-complete
This is a complete repository of the progress that I have made on the proactive Omnichannel 365 chat widget.

#Directories
Each directory is a different implementation.

The **"custom button"** directory is the custom chat button/potential custom proactive chat.

The **"demonstration"** directory is the exact code from the meeting that I created.

The **"original"** directory is the chatbot implementation uses the stock proactive chat buttons on an example page.

The **"real site"** directory shows how the implementation would work using a real saved webpage.
